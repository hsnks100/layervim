# Layervim Introduce
Basically, vim has a lot of plugin managers.

Each plug-in is easy to manage, but as the number increases, managing the config files and plug-ins is very difficult.

So I created a vim framework to solve it.

I want that I have minimal vim-configuration to categorize configuration-files. Thus I had used spacevim, ... stuff like that.

However I can't find vim-configuration-framework for me. spacevim is very huge, It is difficult to categorize vim-configuration-files for me.

I maked minimal vim-configuration-framework called layervim.

LayerVim help you to categorize your vim-configuration. LayerVim also can recognite any directory-name though, your vim must support python2 or python3. 

I also referenced spacevim codes.

This LayerVim is Vim Configuration.
